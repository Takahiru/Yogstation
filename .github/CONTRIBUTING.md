# CONTRIBUTING

## Reporting Issues

See [this page](http://tgstation13.org/wiki/Reporting_Issues) for a guide and format to issue reports.

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to Yogstation's contributing page. You are here because you are curious or interested in contributing - thank you! Everyone is free to contribute to this project as long as they follow the simple guidelines and specifications below; at Yogstation, we strive to maintain code stability and maintainability, and to do that, we need all pull requests to hold up to those specifications. It's in everyone's best interests - including yours! - if the same bug doesn't have to be fixed twice because of duplicated code.

First things first, we want to make it clear how you can contribute (if you've never contributed before), as well as the kinds of powers the team has over your additions, to avoid any unpleasant surprises if your pull request is closed for a reason you didn't foresee.

## Getting Started

Yogstation doesn't have a list of goals and features to add; we instead allow freedom for contributors to suggest and create their ideas for the game. That doesn't mean we aren't determined to squash bugs, which unfortunately pop up a lot due to the deep complexity of the game. Here are some useful starting guides, if you want to contribute or if you want to know what challenges you can tackle with zero knowledge about the game's code structure.

If you want to contribute the first thing you'll need to do is [set up Git](https://wiki.yogstation.net/wiki/Setting_up_git) so you can download the source code.

We have a [list of guides on the wiki](https://wiki.yogstation.net/wiki/Guides#Development_and_Contribution_Guides) that will help you get started contributing to Yogstation with Git and Dream Maker. For beginners, it is recommended you work on small projects like bug fixes at first. If you need help learning to program in BYOND, check out this [repository of resources](http://www.byond.com/developer/articles/resources).

You can of course, as always, ask for help in #coder-public on the [discord](https://discord.gg/0keg6hQH05Ha8OfO). We're just here to have fun and help out, so please don't expect professional support.

## Meet the Team

**Head Developer**

The Head Developer(s) are responsible for controlling, adding, and removing maintainers from the project. In addition to filling the role of a normal maintainer, they have sole authority on who becomes a maintainer, as well as who remains a maintainer and who does not.

**Maintainers**

Maintainers are quality control. If a proposed pull request doesn't meet the specifications laid out in this document, they can request you to change it, or simply just close the pull request. Maintainers are required to wait 24 hours before closing a pull request, and must give a reason for closing the pull request.

Maintainers can revert your changes if they feel they are not worth maintaining or if they did not live up to the quality specifications.

## Yogstation GitHub Guidelines

### General Rules

**Yogstation is an open source community-driven project that allows everybody to contribute their ideas towards making rounds on Space Station 13 as fun as possible by means of pull requests and issue reports to the main repository.**

**Although we allow conversation on GitHub in Pull Requests/Issues, we ask that all contributors and maintainers maintain a sense of decorum and respect the author and other people contributing to the discussion.** If someone is constantly contributing negative statements or is not constructive in their criticism they may be asked to stop or have their right to contribute removed in the future.

**The GitHub Terms and Conditions must be followed.** Failure to follow the terms and conditions of GitHub may result in your exclusion from contribution in the future. 

**We do not require people to be signed up on the forums or Discord in order to contribute to the GitHub; however, there must be a way for maintainers to be able to contact you, either via Discord (preferably) or e-mail when concerns with identity are found and need to be resolved.** Being banned from the server does not automatically ban you from GitHub and vice versa; however, this is up to the discretion of the head developers. Your pull requests may all be placed on hold until you accept this request for communication.

### Contributors

**When you are creating a Pull Request/Issue Report**, please make sure you name the Pull Request/Issue something relevant to what is being changed, added, or removed. Do not attempt to mislead people about the content of the Pull Request/Issue. Make sure you fill out any applicable templates as clearly and concisely as possible, and link any relevant issues your Pull Request solves.

**We do not limit the amount of Pull Requests which can be submitted per day**; however, please do not submit more than is necessary. Additionally, please do not harass any member of the development team to expedite or merge your Pull Request. In certain circumstances, such as the case of a game breaking bug or issue, please reach out and inform them as soon as possible.

**We allow users to create draft Pull Requests in order to have time to work on features and solicit feedback on those features**; however, there will be a limit of 2 draft Pull Requests per person, as we want people to finish their projects before moving onto others as soon as possible.

**In regards to Revert Pull Requests**, these should only be opened if there is a reason for the reversion ie. the feature is broken or is not as expected when it was merged. Otherwise please wait at least 48 hours before reversing a change.

### Maintainers

**As a maintainer, you are a representative of the development team, as such you should act with a somewhat professional manner when dealing with contributions, including constructively commenting on PRs.**

**All maintainers should follow set standards for handling Pull Requests.** These standards include waiting 24 hours before merging or closing a Pull Request, as well as merging only Pull Requests that fall under your area of expertise (i.e. an Art Maintainer should not merge code, and a Code Maintainer should not merge art.) Lastly, revert Pull Requests should only be merged by a Head Developer. The above limitations do not apply to round-breaking or repo-breaking changes; however, please notify any head developers if this occurs.

**All maintainers should encourage discourse and collaboration.** As such, maintainers should only close draft Pull Requests if:
* A contributor has more than 2 draft Pull Requests open, in which the oldest draft Pull Request should be closed until the author closes another.
* A contributor has opened a draft Pull Request that has no changes present in it after the initial 24 hours.
* A contributor has not contributed to their draft Pull Request in a week’s time.
* The Pull Request was opened with inadequate rationale or is lacking naming or following existing guidelines.


**If a Maintainer/Director gets banned from the server/Discord, there will be an automatic review process triggered.** During this time access to GitHub merging and in-game ranks will be removed until the review is complete. After this review, roles and permissions may be returned depending on the result.

### Contributor-Maintainer Disputes

**If you have any complaints about maintainers or contributors you can use the GitHub report function**; however, abuse of this feature will be addressed if needed.

**You may also raise an issue on discord by going to the #head-dev-complaints channel and creating a private thread**, then pinging head developers to make sure they are notified.

**These policies are enforced by the Head Developer(s) and are subject to change at their discretion, with or without notification to the general public.**

## Specifications

As mentioned before, you are expected to follow these specifications in order to make everyone's lives easier. It'll save both your time and ours, by making sure you don't have to make any changes and we don't have to ask you to. Thank you for reading this section!

### Object Oriented Code
As BYOND's Dream Maker (henceforth "DM") is an object-oriented language, code must be object-oriented when possible in order to be more flexible when adding content to it. If you don't know what "object-oriented" means, we highly recommend you do some light research to grasp the basics.

### All BYOND paths must contain the full path
(i.e. absolute pathing)

DM will allow you nest almost any type keyword into a block, such as:

```DM
datum
	datum1
		var
			varname1 = 1
			varname2
		proc
			proc1()
				code
			proc2()
				code

		datum2
			varname1 = 0
			proc
				proc3()
					code
			proc2()
				..()
				code
```

The use of this is not allowed in this project as it makes finding definitions via full text searching next to impossible. The only exception is the variables of an object may be nested to the object, but must not nest further.

The previous code made compliant:

```DM
/datum/datum1
	var/varname1
	var/varname2

/datum/datum1/proc/proc1()
	code
/datum/datum1/proc/proc2()
	code
/datum/datum1/datum2
	varname1 = 0
/datum/datum1/datum2/proc/proc3()
	code
/datum/datum1/datum2/proc2()
	..()
	code
```

### No overriding type safety checks
The use of the : operator to override type safety checks is not allowed. You must cast the variable to the proper type.

### Type paths must begin with a /
eg: `/datum/thing`, not `datum/thing`

### Type paths must be lowercase
eg: `/datum/thing/blue`, not `datum/thing/BLUE` or `datum/thing/Blue`

### Datum type paths must began with "datum"
In DM, this is optional, but omitting it makes finding definitions harder.

### Do not use text/string based type paths
It is rarely allowed to put type paths in a text format, as there are no compile errors if the type path no longer exists. Here is an example:

```DM
//Good
var/path_type = /obj/item/baseball_bat

//Bad
var/path_type = "/obj/item/baseball_bat"
```

### Use var/name format when declaring variables
While DM allows other ways of declaring variables, this one should be used for consistency.

### Variable names must not be the same as a proc name
```DM
//Don't do this
/obj
    var/block_attack = TRUE

/obj/proc/block_attack()
    return density
```
### Tabs, not spaces
You must use tabs to indent your code, NOT SPACES.

(You may use spaces to align something, but you should tab to the block level first, then add the remaining spaces)

### No hacky code
Hacky code, such as adding specific checks, is highly discouraged and only allowed when there is ***no*** other option. (Protip: 'I couldn't immediately think of a proper way so thus there must be no other option' is not gonna cut it here! If you can't think of anything else, say that outright and admit that you need help with it. Maintainers exist for exactly that reason.)

You can avoid hacky code by using object-oriented methodologies, such as overriding a function (called "procs" in DM) or sectioning code into functions and then overriding them as required.

### No duplicated code
Copying code from one place to another may be suitable for small, short-time projects, but yogstation is a long-term project and highly discourages this.

Instead you can use object orientation, or simply placing repeated code in a function, to obey this specification easily.

### Startup/Runtime tradeoffs with lists and the "hidden" init proc
First, read the comments in [this BYOND thread](http://www.byond.com/forum/?post=2086980&page=2#comment19776775), starting where the link takes you.

There are two key points here:

1) Defining a list in the variable's definition calls a hidden proc - init. If you have to define a list at startup, do so in New() (or preferably Initialize()) and avoid the overhead of a second call (Init() and then New())

2) It also consumes more memory to the point where the list is actually required, even if the object in question may never use it!

Remember: although this tradeoff makes sense in many cases, it doesn't cover them all. Think carefully about your addition before deciding if you need to use it.

### Prefer `Initialize()` over `New()` for atoms
Our game controller is pretty good at handling long operations and lag, but it can't control what happens when the map is loaded, which calls `New` for all atoms on the map. If you're creating a new atom, use the `Initialize` proc to do what you would normally do in `New`. This cuts down on the number of proc calls needed when the world is loaded. See here for details on `Initialize`: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/master/code/game/atoms.dm#L49
While we normally encourage (and in some cases, even require) bringing out of date code up to date when you make unrelated changes near the out of date code, that is not the case for `New` -> `Initialize` conversions. These systems are generally more dependant on parent and children procs so unrelated random conversions of existing things can cause bugs that take months to figure out.

### No magic numbers or strings
This means stuff like having a "mode" variable for an object set to "1" or "2" with no clear indicator of what that means. Make these #defines with a name that more clearly states what it's for. For instance:
````DM
/datum/proc/do_the_thing(thing_to_do)
	switch(thing_to_do)
		if(1)
			(...)
		if(2)
			(...)
````
There's no indication of what "1" and "2" mean! Instead, you'd do something like this:
````DM
#define DO_THE_THING_REALLY_HARD 1
#define DO_THE_THING_EFFICIENTLY 2
/datum/proc/do_the_thing(thing_to_do)
	switch(thing_to_do)
		if(DO_THE_THING_REALLY_HARD)
			(...)
		if(DO_THE_THING_EFFICIENTLY)
			(...)
````
This is clearer and enhances readability of your code! Get used to doing it!

### Control statements
(if, while, for, etc)

* All control statements must not contain code on the same line as the statement (`if (blah) return`)
* All control statements comparing a variable to a number should use the formula of `thing` `operator` `number`, not the reverse (eg: `if (count <= 10)` not `if (10 >= count)`)

### Use early return
Do not enclose a proc in an if-block when returning on a condition is more feasible
This is bad:
````DM
/datum/datum1/proc/proc1()
	if (thing1)
		if (!thing2)
			if (thing3 == 30)
				do stuff
````
This is good:
````DM
/datum/datum1/proc/proc1()
	if (!thing1)
		return
	if (thing2)
		return
	if (thing3 != 30)
		return
	do stuff
````
This prevents nesting levels from getting deeper then they need to be.

### Develop Secure Code

* Player input must always be escaped safely, we recommend you use stripped_input in all cases where you would use input. Essentially, just always treat input from players as inherently malicious and design with that use case in mind

* Calls to the database must be escaped properly - use sanitizeSQL to escape text based database entries from players or admins, and isnum() for number based database entries from players or admins.

* All calls to topics must be checked for correctness. Topic href calls can be easily faked by clients, so you should ensure that the call is valid for the state the item is in. Do not rely on the UI code to provide only valid topic calls, because it won't.

* Information that players could use to metagame (that is, to identify round information and/or antagonist type via information that would not be available to them in character) should be kept as administrator only.

* It is recommended as well you do not expose information about the players - even something as simple as the number of people who have readied up at the start of the round can and has been used to try to identify the round type.

* Where you have code that can cause large-scale modification and *FUN*, make sure you start it out locked behind one of the default admin roles - use common sense to determine which role fits the level of damage a function could do.

### Files
* Because runtime errors do not give the full path, try to avoid having files with the same name across folders.

* File names should not be mixed case, or contain spaces or any character that would require escaping in a uri.

* Files and path accessed and referenced by code above simply being #included should be strictly lowercase to avoid issues on filesystems where case matters.

### SQL
* Do not use the shorthand sql insert format (where no column names are specified) because it unnecessarily breaks all queries on minor column changes and prevents using these tables for tracking outside related info such as in a connected site/forum.

* All changes to the database's layout(schema) must be specified in the database changelog in SQL, as well as reflected in the schema files

* Any time the schema is changed the `schema_revision` table and `DB_MAJOR_VERSION` or `DB_MINOR_VERSION` defines must be incremented.

* Queries must never specify the database, be it in code, or in text files in the repo.

* Primary keys are inherently immutable and you must never do anything to change the primary key of a row or entity. This includes preserving auto increment numbers of rows when copying data to a table in a conversion script. No amount of bitching about gaps in ids or out of order ids will save you from this policy.

### Mapping Standards
* TGM Format & Map Merge
	* All new maps submitted to the repo through a pull request must be in TGM format (unless there is a valid reason present to have it in the default BYOND format.) This is done using the [Map Merge](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/wiki/Map-Merger) utility included in the repo to convert the file to TGM format.
	* Likewise, you MUST run Map Merge prior to opening your PR when updating existing maps to minimize the change differences (even when using third party mapping programs such as FastDMM.)
		* Failure to run Map Merge on a map after using third party mapping programs (such as FastDMM) greatly increases the risk of the map's key dictionary becoming corrupted by future edits after running map merge. Resolving the corruption issue involves rebuilding the map's key dictionary; id est rewriting all the keys contained within the map by reconverting it from BYOND to TGM format - which creates very large differences that ultimately delay the PR process and is extremely likely to cause merge conflicts with other pull requests.

* Variable Editing (Var-edits)
	* While var-editing an item within the editor is perfectly fine, it is preferred that when you are changing the base behavior of an item (how it functions) that you make a new subtype of that item within the code, especially if you plan to use the item in multiple locations on the same map, or across multiple maps. This makes it easier to make corrections as needed to all instances of the item at one time as opposed to having to find each instance of it and change them all individually.
		* Subtypes only intended to be used on away mission or ruin maps should be contained within an .dm file with a name corresponding to that map within `code\modules\awaymissions` or `code\modules\ruins` respectively. This is so in the event that the map is removed, that subtype will be removed at the same time as well to minimize leftover/unused data within the repo.
	* Please attempt to clean out any dirty variables that may be contained within items you alter through var-editing. For example, due to how DM functions, changing the `pixel_x` variable from 23 to 0 will leave a dirty record in the map's code of `pixel_x = 0`. Likewise this can happen when changing an item's icon to something else and then back. This can lead to some issues where an item's icon has changed within the code, but becomes broken on the map due to it still attempting to use the old entry.
	* Areas should not be var-edited on a map to change it's name or attributes. All areas of a single type and it's altered instances are considered the same area within the code, and editing their variables on a map can lead to issues with powernets and event subsystems which are difficult to debug.


### Other Notes
* Code should be modular where possible; if you are working on a new addition, then strongly consider putting it in its own file unless it makes sense to put it with similar ones (i.e. a new tool would go in the "tools.dm" file)

* Bloated code may be necessary to add a certain feature, which means there has to be a judgement over whether the feature is worth having or not. You can help make this decision easier by making sure your code is modular.

* You are expected to help maintain the code that you add, meaning that if there is a problem then you are likely to be approached in order to fix any issues, runtimes, or bugs.

* Do not divide when you can easily convert it to multiplication. (ie `4/2` should be done as `4*0.5`)

* If you used regex to replace code during development of your code, post the regex in your PR for the benefit of future developers and downstream users.

* Changes to the `/config` tree must be made in a way that allows for updating server deployments while preserving previous behaviour. This is due to the fact that the config tree is to be considered owned by the user and not necessarily updated alongside the remainder of the code. The code to preserve previous behaviour may be removed at some point in the future given the OK by maintainers.

* The dlls section of tgs3.json is not designed for dlls that are purely `call()()`ed since those handles are closed between world reboots. Only put in dlls that may have to exist between world reboots.

#### Enforced not enforced
The following coding styles are not only not enforced at all, but are generally frowned upon to change for little to no reason:

* English/British spelling on var/proc names
	* Color/Colour - both are fine, but keep in mind that BYOND uses `color` as a base variable
* Spaces after control statements
	* `if()` and `if ()` - nobody cares!

### Operators
#### Spacing
(this is not strictly enforced, but more a guideline for readability's sake)

* Operators that should be separated by spaces
	* Boolean and logic operators like &&, || <, >, ==, etc (but not !)
	* Bitwise AND &
	* Argument separator operators like , (and ; when used in a forloop)
	* Assignment operators like = or += or the like
* Operators that should not be separated by spaces
	* Bitwise OR |
	* Access operators like . and :
	* Parentheses ()
	* logical not !

Math operators like +, -, /, *, etc are up in the air, just choose which version looks more readable.

#### Use
* Bitwise AND - '&'
	* Should be written as ```bitfield & bitflag``` NEVER ```bitflag & bitfield```, both are valid, but the latter is confusing and nonstandard.
* Associated lists declarations must have their key value quoted if it's a string
	* WRONG: list(a = "b")
	* RIGHT: list("a" = "b")

### Dream Maker Quirks/Tricks
Like all languages, Dream Maker has its quirks, some of them are beneficial to us, like these

#### In-To for-loops
```for(var/i = 1, i <= some_value, i++)``` is a fairly standard way to write an incremental for loop in most languages (especially those in the C family), but DM's ```for(var/i in 1 to some_value)``` syntax is oddly faster than its implementation of the former syntax; where possible, it's advised to use DM's syntax. (Note, the ```to``` keyword is inclusive, so it automatically defaults to replacing ```<=```; if you want ```<``` then you should write it as ```1 to some_value-1```).

HOWEVER, if either ```some_value``` or ```i``` changes within the body of the for (underneath the ```for(...)``` header) or if you are looping over a list AND changing the length of the list then you can NOT use this type of for-loop!

### for(var/A in list) VS for(var/i in 1 to list.len)
The former is faster than the latter, as shown by the following profile results:
https://file.house/zy7H.png
Code used for the test in a readable format:
https://pastebin.com/w50uERkG


#### Istypeless for loops
A name for a differing syntax for writing for-each style loops in DM. It's NOT DM's standard syntax, hence why this is considered a quirk. Take a look at this:
```DM
var/list/bag_of_items = list(sword, apple, coinpouch, sword, sword)
var/obj/item/sword/best_sword
for(var/obj/item/sword/S in bag_of_items)
	if(!best_sword || S.damage > best_sword.damage)
		best_sword = S
```
The above is a simple proc for checking all swords in a container and returning the one with the highest damage, and it uses DM's standard syntax for a for-loop by specifying a type in the variable of the for's header that DM interprets as a type to filter by. It performs this filter using ```istype()``` (or some internal-magic similar to ```istype()``` - this is BYOND, after all). This is fine in its current state for ```bag_of_items```, but if ```bag_of_items``` contained ONLY swords, or only SUBTYPES of swords, then the above is inefficient. For example:
```DM
var/list/bag_of_swords = list(sword, sword, sword, sword)
var/obj/item/sword/best_sword
for(var/obj/item/sword/S in bag_of_swords)
	if(!best_sword || S.damage > best_sword.damage)
		best_sword = S
```
specifies a type for DM to filter by. 

With the previous example that's perfectly fine, we only want swords, but here the bag only contains swords? Is DM still going to try to filter because we gave it a type to filter by? YES, and here comes the inefficiency. Wherever a list (or other container, such as an atom (in which case you're technically accessing their special contents list, but that's irrelevant)) contains datums of the same datatype or subtypes of the datatype you require for your loop's body,
you can circumvent DM's filtering and automatic ```istype()``` checks by writing the loop as such:
```DM
var/list/bag_of_swords = list(sword, sword, sword, sword)
var/obj/item/sword/best_sword
for(var/s in bag_of_swords)
	var/obj/item/sword/S = s
	if(!best_sword || S.damage > best_sword.damage)
		best_sword = S
```
Of course, if the list contains data of a mixed type then the above optimisation is DANGEROUS, as it will blindly typecast all data in the list as the specified type, even if it isn't really that type, causing runtime errors.

#### Dot variable
Like other languages in the C family, DM has a ```.``` or "Dot" operator, used for accessing variables/members/functions of an object instance.
eg:
```DM
var/mob/living/carbon/human/H = YOU_THE_READER
H.gib()
```
However, DM also has a dot variable, accessed just as ```.``` on its own, defaulting to a value of null. Now, what's special about the dot operator is that it is automatically returned (as in the ```return``` statement) at the end of a proc, provided the proc does not already manually return (```return count``` for example.) Why is this special?

With ```.``` being everpresent in every proc, can we use it as a temporary variable? Of course we can! However, the ```.``` operator cannot replace a typecasted variable - it can hold data any other var in DM can, it just can't be accessed as one, although the ```.``` operator is compatible with a few operators that look weird but work perfectly fine, such as: ```.++``` for incrementing ```.'s``` value, or ```.[1]``` for accessing the first element of ```.```, provided that it's a list.

## Globals versus static

DM has a var keyword, called global. This var keyword is for vars inside of types. For instance:

```DM
mob
	var
		global
			thing = TRUE
```
This does NOT mean that you can access it everywhere like a global var. Instead, it means that that var will only exist once for all instances of its type, in this case that var will only exist once for all mobs - it's shared across everything in its type. (Much more like the keyword `static` in other languages like PHP/C++/C#/Java)

Isn't that confusing? 

There is also an undocumented keyword called `static` that has the same behaviour as global but more correctly describes BYOND's behaviour. Therefore, we always use static instead of global where we need it, as it reduces suprise when reading BYOND code.

## Pull Request Process

There is no strict process when it comes to merging pull requests. Pull requests will sometimes take a while before they are looked at by a maintainer; the bigger the change, the more time it will take before they are accepted into the code. Every team member is a volunteer who is giving up their own time to help maintain and contribute, so please be courteous and respectful. Here are some helpful ways to make it easier for you and for the maintainers when making a pull request.

* Make sure your pull request complies to the requirements outlined in [this guide](http://tgstation13.org/wiki/Getting_Your_Pull_Accepted)

* You are going to be expected to document all your changes in the pull request. Failing to do so will mean delaying it as we will have to question why you made the change. On the other hand, you can speed up the process by making the pull request readable and easy to understand, with diagrams or before/after data.

* We ask that you use the changelog system to document your player facing changes, which prevents our players from being caught unaware by said changes - you can find more information about this [on this wiki page](http://tgstation13.org/wiki/Guide_to_Changelogs).

* If you are proposing multiple changes, which change many different aspects of the code, you are expected to section them off into different pull requests in order to make it easier to review them and to deny/accept the changes that are deemed acceptable.

* If your pull request is accepted, the code you add no longer belongs exclusively to you but to everyone; everyone is free to work on it, but you are also free to support or object to any changes being made, which will likely hold more weight, as you're the one who added the feature. It is a shame this has to be explicitly said, but there have been cases where this would've saved some trouble.

* Please explain why you are submitting the pull request, and how you think your change will be beneficial to the game. Failure to do so will be grounds for rejecting the PR.

* If your pull request is not finished make sure it is at least testable in a live environment. Pull requests that do not at least meet this requirement will be closed. You may request a maintainer reopen the pull request when you're ready, or make a new one.

* While we have no issue helping contributors (and especially new contributors) bring reasonably sized contributions up to standards via the pull request review process, larger contributions are expected to pass a higher bar of completeness and code quality *before* you open a pull request. Maintainers may close such pull requests that are deemed to be substantially flawed. You should take some time to discuss with maintainers or other contributors on how to improve the changes.

## Porting features/sprites/sounds/tools from other codebases

If you are porting features/tools from other codebases, you must give them credit where it's due. Typically, crediting them in your pull request and the changelog is the recommended way of doing it. Take note of what license they use though, porting stuff from AGPLv3 and GPLv3 codebases are allowed.

Regarding sprites & sounds, you must credit the artist and possibly the codebase. All yogstation assets including icons and sound are under a [Creative Commons 3.0 BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) unless otherwise indicated. However if you are porting assets from GoonStation or usually any assets under the [Creative Commons 3.0 BY-NC-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) are to go into the 'goon' folder of the yogstation codebase.

## A word on Git
All .dmm .dm .md .txt .html are required to end with CRLF(DOS/WINDOWS) line endings,git will enforce said line endings automatically. Other file types have non enforced line endings.
